SparkChassisPlans
=================
First version of the CoroBot Spark Chassis components that were made available the day before the Kickstarter project was made live. These plans are made feely available to anyone free of charge.
We only ask that if you find any value in them, please give back to the community that we have worked
so hard on developing. This can come in many different forms such as just becoming an evangelists for
the CoroBot Spark Project or donating to the Kickstarter project. The success of any open source
project is with its community.
